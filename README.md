# solinv

**Solana-aware invariant fuzzing framework.** A library + plugin on
top of [Crucible](https://github.com/asymmetric-research/crucible)
that ships Solana-specific bug-class detectors as auto-invariants, so
audit firms and protocol teams don't have to hand-author every
`fuzz_assert!` themselves.

Apache-2.0 licensed. Sibling to
[pinocchio-bench](https://github.com/psyto/pinocchio-bench) — the
public CU-measurement leaderboard comparing Anchor vs Pinocchio
across 13 DeFi hot paths.

## What this is

Existing Solana fuzzers (Crucible, [Trident](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/trident))
provide coverage-guided execution and snapshot infrastructure. They
ask the user to declare what counts as a bug. Solinv ships that
declaration as a library:

1. **Pre-built Solana invariants — catalog 10/10** end-to-end against
   planted bugs and clean against hardened production code:
   **Critical 5** (signer-skip, owner-skip, discriminator-skip,
   pda-forge, account-swap) + **High 5** (unchecked-math, cu-dos,
   cpi-reentrancy, realloc-race, bump-seed-canonicalization). Each
   ships with a 10-section spec doc, Gate 1 planted-bug acceptance,
   and Gate 2 production-target calibration evidence.
2. **Honest calibration data** — production code is mostly clean.
   Solinv publishes the null results alongside the catalog so the
   detectors' sensitivity is auditable rather than implied. As of
   the 5-invariant calibration sweep on Raydium AMM SwapV2:
   **168,531 executions / 0 violations** across 5 distinct detection
   mechanisms.
3. **Pre-commit kill-criterion methodology** — every invariant ships
   with a §9 pre-committed experiment design (Gate 1 + Gate 2 binary
   outcomes) and a §10 honest framing of any decision overrides. The
   methodology has been empirically tested across 5 invariants × Day
   34 / 38 / 58 / 59 / 60 result docs.
4. **Layer-of-responsibility framing** — each bug class is mapped to
   what Solana's runtime defends against vs what the protocol must
   own. See [the catalog summary table](#layer-of-responsibility-scale)
   below.
5. **Bytepoke helper API** — `solinv-fuzz::bytepoke` provides
   reusable Anchor-discriminator + sighash + byte-offset writers +
   `AnchorAccountBuilder` so adopting solinv on an Anchor 0.x program
   (where the LiteSVM/Anchor ABI mismatch blocks init paths) takes
   minutes instead of hours.
6. **Disclosure templates** — Immunefi / Sherlock / direct-to-protocol
   markdown templates with field-by-field guidance + a worked example
   from solinv's own planted-bug detection.

Engine performance is **not** the wedge — solinv runs on Crucible and
inherits its sBPF coverage and libafl scheduling.

## Layer-of-responsibility scale

| Invariant | Solana runtime defense | Protocol responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| unchecked-math | none | total |
| cu-dos | per-tx 200K CU cap | total within cap |
| cpi-reentrancy | writable-account locks (same-account only) | partial (different-account / proxy paths) |
| realloc-race | near-total (rent check at tx commit) | intent only |
| bump-seed-canonicalization | none | total (use `find_program_address` + store canonical bump) |
| signer-skip | none (Anchor framework helps for `Signer<'info>`) | total for raw `AccountInfo` |
| owner-skip | none (Anchor framework helps for typed `Account<'info, T>`) | total for `UncheckedAccount` |
| discriminator-skip | none | total |
| pda-forge | none at read-time (runtime checks `invoke_signed` only) | total |
| account-swap | none | total |

The scale anchors solinv's value-add: detectors target precisely the
layer Solana's runtime doesn't own, where the protocol's
responsibility is total or near-total.

## Paired with pinocchio-bench

[psyto/pinocchio-bench](https://github.com/psyto/pinocchio-bench) is
the public CU-measurement leaderboard comparing Anchor 0.32.1 vs
Pinocchio 0.11.1 across 13 representative DeFi hot paths (W0-W12:
no-op through perp `open_position`). Two scaling laws now hold across
the dataset:

| Dimension | Marginal Anchor overhead |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| Per additional mutable zero-copy account | ~329 CU |
| Per additional CPI hop | ~1,968 CU |

Pinocchio-bench answers _"how much CU is on the table?"_. Solinv
answers _"can a Pinocchio rewrite preserve the original program's
behavior?"_. The leaderboard lists 5-6 invariants per workload that a
fuzzer "would attach" for each surface (orderbook tick insert, AMM
constant-product, lending refresh, vault NAV, oracle publish, perp
margin); solinv is the framework that actually attaches them.

## Quickstart — escrow-demo (catalog 10/10)

```bash
# Install Crucible CLI (one-time)
git clone https://github.com/asymmetric-research/crucible ~/src/crucible
cargo install --path ~/src/crucible/crates/crucible-fuzz-cli

# Build the planted-bug program (one planted bug per High-tier invariant
# + the Critical-5 acceptance fixture)
cd examples/escrow-demo
cargo build-sbf --tools-version v1.52 --manifest-path programs/escrow/Cargo.toml

# Run each invariant in isolation
for inv in signer_skip owner_skip discriminator_skip pda_forge account_swap \
           unchecked_math cu_dos cpi_reentrancy realloc_race \
           bump_seed_canonicalization; do
    crucible run escrow invariant_${inv}_only --release --timeout 30
done
```

Each campaign reports its respective invariant's violation against the
planted bug. Detection rates range from ~2% (`bump-seed-canonicalization`'s
substitution attack requires the canonical vault to exist first; state
buildup gates reachability) to ~99% (deterministic mechanisms like
`unchecked-math` / `cu-dos` / `realloc-race`). See
[`examples/escrow-demo/README.md`](examples/escrow-demo/README.md)
for per-variant detection numbers and the combined acceptance variant.

## Calibration dataset

The 5 High-tier invariants tested under apples-to-apples Gate 2
conditions against Raydium AMM SwapV2:

| Invariant | Mechanism | Executions | Violations |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| unchecked-math | state mutation (Bounded) | 15,380 | 0 |
| cu-dos | per-ix CU consumption | 25,650 | 0 |
| cpi-reentrancy | CPI call-tree logs | 27,573 | 0 |
| realloc-race | runtime err + post-state | 24,381 | 0 |
| bump-seed-canonicalization | alt-PDA substitution | 75,547 | 0 |
| **Total** | | **168,531** | **0** |

5 distinct detection mechanisms × 1 hardened production target × 0
violations. Edge saturation 629/14,696 identical across all 5 runs —
additional time would not have changed the outcome. The dataset is
the empirical backbone of solinv's "honest tested-and-found-nothing"
framing. Full per-Gate methodology in
[`docs/phase5-day60-bump-seed-canonicalization-gates.md`](docs/phase5-day60-bump-seed-canonicalization-gates.md).

## Invariant catalog (10/10 complete)

The catalog targets Solana's distinctive account model and
runtime-specific bug surfaces.

| # | Tier | Name | Bug class | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Critical | signer-skip | missing `is_signer` on authorization-required account | [`docs/invariants/signer-skip.md`](docs/invariants/signer-skip.md) |
| 2 | Critical | owner-skip | missing `account.owner == expected_program` check | [`docs/invariants/owner-skip.md`](docs/invariants/owner-skip.md) |
| 3 | Critical | discriminator-skip | missing Anchor account discriminator check | [`docs/invariants/discriminator-skip.md`](docs/invariants/discriminator-skip.md) |
| 4 | Critical | pda-forge | PDA seed not verified at read time, attacker forges arbitrary PDA | [`docs/invariants/pda-forge.md`](docs/invariants/pda-forge.md) |
| 5 | Critical | account-swap | wrong-context PDA — missing context-binding check | [`docs/invariants/account-swap.md`](docs/invariants/account-swap.md) |
| 6 | High | unchecked-math | arithmetic overflow / wrap reaching protocol state | [`docs/invariants/unchecked-math.md`](docs/invariants/unchecked-math.md) |
| 7 | High | cu-dos | single ix consumes >limit CU → permanent DoS | [`docs/invariants/cu-dos.md`](docs/invariants/cu-dos.md) |
| 8 | High | cpi-reentrancy | CPI cycle through caller program → state-coherence break (Mango v3 class) | [`docs/invariants/cpi-reentrancy.md`](docs/invariants/cpi-reentrancy.md) |
| 9 | High | realloc-race | data buffer grown past rent-exempt threshold without lamport top-up | [`docs/invariants/realloc-race.md`](docs/invariants/realloc-race.md) |
| 10 | High | bump-seed-canonicalization | non-canonical PDA bump accepted; alt-PDA substitution attack | [`docs/invariants/bump-seed-canonicalization.md`](docs/invariants/bump-seed-canonicalization.md) |

Medium tier (roadmap, not yet specced): close-reopen,
sysvar-manipulation, permissionless-misuse, rent-exemption,
account-init-race.

Each implemented invariant ships with:
- A spec doc under `docs/invariants/` (8 sections + a §9 pre-committed
  kill criterion for the gated experiments)
- Reference implementation under `crates/solinv-core/src/invariants/`
- Planted-bug fixture in `examples/escrow-demo/`
- Regression tests covering both detect-pair (when in-tree) and
  non-detect baseline

## Validated targets

| Target | Class | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `examples/escrow-demo` | planted bugs across 5 handlers, 7 invariants | 7/7 planted bugs detected end-to-end ([Day 13 Critical 5/5](docs/implementation-day13-owner-skip-unmask-CRITICAL-COMPLETE.md), Day 33 unchecked-math + Day 37 cu-dos Gate 1) |
| `examples/raydium-amm-fuzz` | Native production AMM, 5 invariants × SwapBaseInV2 + OutV2 | 25,383 attacks → **0 violations** ([Day 21](docs/phase2-day21-raydium-extension.md)) |
| `examples/slumlord-fuzz` | Native flash-loan program (Igneous Labs) | 86,391 exec × 5 invariants → **0 violations** ([Day 43](docs/phase4-day43-slumlord-result.md)) |
| Raydium SwapV2 + unchecked-math | High-tier, Gate 2 | 0 violations / 15K exec ([Day 34](docs/phase3-day34-unchecked-math-gate2.md)) |
| Raydium SwapV2 + cu-dos | High-tier, Gate 2 | 0 violations / 25K exec ([Day 38](docs/phase3-day38-cu-dos-gate2.md)) |

**On hardened production code: 0 violations across 3 invariant classes
× 3 protocols × ~150K total executions.** This is the empirical
calibration result: solinv's invariants are sensitive to planted bugs
and silent against well-engineered production code. The dataset is
preserved as the project's published-honest baseline.

## Reachability status

Solinv inherits Crucible's LiteSVM (currently v0.9.1) for in-process
program execution. Different program classes have different reachability:

| Program class | Reachability | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Native (any `solana-program` 1.16+) | ✅ works | Raydium AMM, Slumlord, Save (ex-Solend), Jito restaking |
| Anchor 1.0+ | ✅ works | escrow-demo |
| Anchor 0.31 + Solana 2.x | ⚠️ builds clean, runtime untested | Meteora DAMM v2, Jito workspace SDK |
| Anchor 0.27-0.29 | ⛔ runtime depth-gated (H1 ABI mismatch) | klend, Sanctum unstake, Marinade |
| Pre-Anchor / `solana-program 1.10` | ⛔ build-gated (toolchain too old) | Wormhole bridge |

**Byte-poke pattern unblocks Anchor 0.x post-init reachability**
without requiring a LiteSVM fork. The `solinv-fuzz::bytepoke` module
provides reusable Anchor discriminator + sighash helpers + byte-offset
writers + an `AnchorAccountBuilder`. Adopting solinv on a
depth-gated Anchor 0.x program: pre-write the target accounts via
the byte-poke API (skipping the broken init→CPI path), then fuzz
the post-init attack surface directly. The klend (Anchor 0.29) and
sanctum-unstake (Anchor 0.28) example harnesses demonstrate the
pattern. See
[`docs/phase4-day47-a1-dig.md`](docs/phase4-day47-a1-dig.md) for the
H1 diagnosis and
[`docs/phase5-day57-bytepoke-helper.md`](docs/phase5-day57-bytepoke-helper.md)
for the helper API + usage.

## Integration — adopting solinv on your own program

Implement two traits on a fixture that already works under Crucible:

```rust
use solinv_fuzz::{HasContext, HasInstructionSet, InstructionSpec};

impl HasContext for MyFixture {
    fn ctx(&self) -> &TestContext { &self.ctx }
    fn ctx_mut(&mut self) -> &mut TestContext { &mut self.ctx }
    fn program_ids(&self) -> Vec<Pubkey> { vec![self.program_id] }
    fn fee_payer(&self) -> Arc<Keypair> { Arc::clone(&self.fee_payer) }
}

impl HasInstructionSet for MyFixture {
    fn instructions(&self) -> Vec<InstructionSpec> {
        vec![InstructionSpec {
            program_id: self.program_id,
            name: "my_ix".into(),
            accounts: vec![/* AccountMeta list */],
            signer_indices: vec![/* indices that must be signers */],
            expected_owners: vec![/* per-account expected owner (or None) */],
            expected_discriminators: vec![/* Anchor disc bytes (or None) */],
            expected_pda_seeds: vec![/* PDA seeds (or None) */],
            // ... see InstructionSpec docs for all 14 fields ...
        }]
    }
}
```

Then call invariants from a single `#[invariant_test]`:

```rust
#[invariant_test]
fn invariant_all(fixture: &mut MyFixture) {
    solinv_core::invariants::signer_skip::check(fixture);
    solinv_core::invariants::owner_skip::check(fixture);
    solinv_core::invariants::discriminator_skip::check(fixture);
    solinv_core::invariants::pda_forge::check(fixture);
    solinv_core::invariants::account_swap::check(fixture);
    solinv_core::invariants::unchecked_math::check(fixture);
    solinv_core::invariants::cu_dos::check(fixture);
}
```

Anchor IDLs auto-fill four of the five Critical-tier fields
(`signer_indices`, `expected_owners`, `expected_discriminators`,
`expected_pda_seeds`); only `swap_alternates` requires manual
context-binding declaration. Native programs declare manually.

Per-invariant attack vectors and false-positive risks are documented
under `docs/invariants/<name>.md` §3 + §5.

## Target scoring + bandit allocation

The CLI ranks bug-bounty / audit targets via a TOML scoring config:

```bash
./target/release/solinv score --config examples/targets.phase4.toml --top 10
./target/release/solinv score --config examples/targets.phase4.toml --top 10 --reachable-only
```

Each target carries a `status` field (`ready` / `exhausted` / `gated`
/ `unverified`) + free-form note, so the rank output reflects what's
actually fuzzable today, not just what scores high in the abstract.

For per-invariant signal-rate tracking across campaigns, solinv emits
machine-readable bandit metrics:

```bash
SOLINV_BANDIT_METRICS=1 crucible run <target> <invariant> --release --timeout 30
# emits: [solinv][bandit] invariant=... dt_sec=... delta_fp=... fp_per_sec=...
```

The `scripts/recommend_bandit_allocation.sh` and
`scripts/bandit_decide.sh` helpers convert log lines into deterministic
allocation decisions (`70/30`, `50/50`, or `early-stop`). Policy:
[`docs/day3-bandit-allocation-policy.md`](docs/day3-bandit-allocation-policy.md).

## Disclosure templates

`docs/disclosure-template-{immunefi,sherlock,generic}.md` each pair a
field-by-field submission template (matching the platform's expected
form shape) with a worked example built from solinv's own
`escrow-demo` planted-bug detection.

When a real finding does emerge during dogfooding, the templates make
it directly submittable without a from-scratch write-up.

## Methodology — pre-commit kill criteria

Every gated invariant ships with a §9 in its spec doc that pre-commits
the experiment's binary outcome before any code runs. Two such gates
have already fired in practice:

- [Day 34 (unchecked-math)](docs/phase3-day34-unchecked-math-gate2.md) — Gate 2 FAIL on Raydium, binding pivot
- [Day 38 (cu-dos)](docs/phase3-day38-cu-dos-gate2.md) — Gate 2 FAIL on Raydium, binding pivot across High tier

This is the methodology contribution as much as the catalog: gated
experiments with binary outcomes, documented in the spec at write-time,
honored at result-time. The pre-commit prevents "let me try one more
thing" drift after a negative result.

## Build + test

```bash
cargo check --workspace               # verify scaffold (~5s)
cargo test  -p solinv-core            # invariant regression tests
cargo build --release                 # build CLI binary
./target/release/solinv --help
```

CLI surface:

```
solinv init                                  # scaffold a solinv harness
solinv check <target>                        # run invariant checks
solinv fuzz <target>                         # run coverage-guided fuzzer
solinv score --config targets.toml           # rank targets by ROI proxy score
solinv corpus fetch --rpc URL --program-id   # ingest mainnet corpus (scaffold)
solinv disclose <bug-id>                     # generate disclosure report (scaffold)
```
